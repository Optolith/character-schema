# Optolith Character Schema

This repository serves as the dedicated place for the character schema for [Optolith](https://github.com/elyukai/optolith-client).

## Structure

The source for the schema generation can be found in the `src` directory. To see how this DSL would translate into actual TypeScript or JSON Schema, check out the `gen` directory, which contains respective generated artifacts.
